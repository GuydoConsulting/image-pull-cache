# Regi*stray*
Regi*stray*: A simple Kubernetes Mutating Webhook Admission Controller that allows you to modify the URL of all image registries in the cluster. Great for configuring a local pull-through cache, or pointing to a local registry mirror in an air gapped cluster without haaving to modify the image location of any of your charts or manifests.
